Yes ‚Äî üíØ putting this in your **repo as a Markdown doc** is *definitely* the better move.
Here‚Äôs why ‚Äî and how I‚Äôd recommend structuring it:

---

### üß© Why Markdown > Google Doc (for your hackathon repo)

| Benefit                                 | Explanation                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version control**                     | Markdown files live alongside your code, so any change in architecture is tracked in Git. You can PR, diff, and review updates just like code. |
| **Transparency for judges & teammates** | Hackathon judges can open `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `README.md` directly on GitHub ‚Äî no link-hopping or permission issues.                          |
| **Better integration with diagrams**    | You can embed the Mermaid diagram directly (GitHub now renders Mermaid natively).                                                              |
| **Future scalability**                  | If you extend this project post-hackathon, the doc grows with your repo, not in a separate Google Drive silo.                                  |
| **Documentation consistency**           | Keeps all design rationale, setup instructions, and architecture diagrams in one place.                                                        |

### üìò What to include in `ARCHITECTURE.md`

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-paste structure you can use right now:

````markdown
# Agentic Video Editing Assistant ‚Äî System Architecture & Workflow

## Overview
Nemotron acts as the **reasoning brain**, while DaVinci Resolve serves as the **editing engine**.  
Nemotron never directly manipulates the timeline; instead, it outputs **structured JSON instructions** that the Python **Tool Adapter** executes via DaVinci‚Äôs scripting API.

This mirrors how an LLM ‚Äúuses‚Äù libraries like NumPy ‚Äî Nemotron decides what to call, the adapter actually runs it.

## Execution Flow

1. **User Input**
   Example: ‚ÄúMake this clip look cinematic and add a slow zoom.‚Äù

2. **Nemotron Reasoning**
   Produces a plan in JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "steps": [
       {"action": "apply_LUT", "params": {"clip_id": "C01", "lut_name": "TealAndOrange", "mix": 0.4}},
       {"action": "add_keyframes", "params": {"property": "zoom", "from": 1.0, "to": 1.08, "duration_s": 5.0}}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Executor / Tool Adapter**
   The Python adapter translates actions into DaVinci API calls:

   ```python
   def apply_LUT(clip_id, lut_name, mix=0.5):
       clip = project.GetClipById(clip_id)
       clip.ApplyLUT(lut_name)
       clip.SetLUTMix(mix)
   ```

4. **Verifier & Feedback Loop**
   Verifies success, requests plan repair if needed.

5. **Explainer UI**
   Displays each step with reasoning and step-by-step manual guidance.

## Design Benefits

* **Tool-Agnostic:** The adapter layer can later support Premiere, After Effects, or Blender.
* **Safe Execution:** Nemotron outputs structured instructions; no arbitrary code execution.
* **Transparent & Auditable:** Every step is logged as JSON and shown to the user.
* **Teachable:** Each action includes rationale, turning automation into a learning tool.

---

## Future Extensions

* **Vision analysis:** Scene and emotion detection.
* **Beat alignment:** Auto-sync cuts to music.
* **Collaborative mode:** Share and replay ‚Äúedit recipes.‚Äù
* **Voice interaction:** ‚ÄúMake it feel like a documentary,‚Äù and the agent plans accordingly.
